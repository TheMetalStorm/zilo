kilo editor, ported from C to Zig!

# Why?
I wanted to work on a project in my free time. A while back I watched a few parts of a Video Series in which someone was porting the Kilo Text Editor to Rust. I though that it would be a nice way to learn a new programming language and I also was interested in learning how a simple text editor works. So I decided to do something similiar, and while I didn't want to dive deeper into Rust (yet?), another langauge had caught my eye. I liked Zigs Syntax and its promises of being a "modern" C alternative, so I got started. 

I've been working on this on and off for a while now, and I am fairly close to completing it! For now it still is a WIP tho. 

Installation/Usage will follow.
